Walmart Project

Please download the project and run as testNG. It will execute the script.

Technical Choices: Used Java as the base language. Using selenium web driver to run the test cases. TestNG to get run the suite. 
Things if I had more time: I would like to keep the data is excel sheet and build a data driven framework. Needed more time for iOS devices. It is working fine for web based. I am not sure on mobile devices. I donâ€™t have much experience on running tests on mobile. We can use Robotium for this purpose.
